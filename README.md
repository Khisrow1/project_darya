# Project Darya (v0.01)
An interpreted programming language (in alpha stage) made specifically for the purpose of teaching programming to students of Non-English communities.
Targeted specifically towards Afghan school kids.\
The Project is written **entirely from scratch** with no external libraries involved, even C runtime library functions are not included in the code.

## Example

## Notice
The project is still in heavy development and so inexperienced users are discouraged to use it as their de-facto programming exercise.\
If you are an experienced C/C++ developer, with knowledge of programming language development, we can work together to finish the project faster.\

## Features in development
1. The language will consist of a **Translation Layer** capable to translating UTF-8 compliant language instructions into the native ANSI code of the interpreter.
2. The code for the translation layer will be modular so that anyone can use the interperter and tranform it to recongize any UTF-8 compliant text as a viable instruction.
3. (Still cooking) The language will have a binding to C/C++ programming language that would allow it to utilize the native platform funcitionalities for heavy-computations, such as rendering graphics and numerial calcualtions in data science applications.
4. Binding to the [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) library, entirely written in C/C++
5. Ability to build executables(exe/dmg/app/apk) that would run independently of the interpreter.
6. Making of a standalone interpreter for ARM NEON architecture that would be deployed to android mobile phones as well as Rasberry Pi (Raspbian/Linux)
